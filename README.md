# Hi there 👋

I’m **Rasya Putri Ardini**, a 3rd-semester Geophysics student at Universitas Gadjah Mada.  
This profile README is part of my assignment, but also a small step to share who I am and what I’m exploring. ✨

## 🌍 What I'm Interested in

I’m fascinated by how **computational methods and data processing** can be applied in geoscience, especially geophysics. Coding, simulations, and data visualization allow us to uncover patterns in complex subsurface data — and that excites me.  

This also connects to my curiosity about the **oil & gas industry** and **consulting**, where analytical thinking and data interpretation are crucial for decision-making. I don’t have it all figured out yet, but I see this time at university as a chance to explore different directions and build a strong foundation with computational tools.

## 📚 What I'm Working On

Right now, I’m focusing on:  

- 🎓 **Academics**: studying, completing assignments, and writing practicum reports.  
- 🤝 **Organizations**: joining activities that align with my career goals and personal growth.  
- 💻 **Computational Methods course**: not just a requirement, but a key subject to sharpen coding skills and systematic problem-solving.  

By combining academic work with organizational experience, I aim to balance **technical expertise** with **soft skills** — both essential for long-term growth.
